* How to use
	1. Download and extract the release to some folder from here if you have not already: https://github.com/kokole/SteamItemDropIdler/releases/download/v2.01/SteamItemDropIdler.zip
	2. Make sure Steam is not running. SteamItemDropIdler may not work properly without this step
	3. If you have Steam installed, rename your Steam folder to something else. For example, if your Steam installation is in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam", rename it to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam123". SteamItemDropIdler may not work properly without this step
	4. Run SteamItemDropIdler
	5. Enter your Steam information, the AppID of the game and the Drop List Definition that you want to idle for. You can find those here: https://github.com/kokole/SteamItemDropIdler/wiki/AppIDs-and-Drop-List-Definitions
	6. It should say "Item drop idling is now in progress"
	7. Keep SteamItemDropIdler open and wait till you get items! To stop, just close SteamItemDropIdler
	
	Note: Do not worry if you get "BeginAuthSession callback failed (5)", everything is working correctly.
